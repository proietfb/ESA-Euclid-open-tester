Euclid is an ESA Cosmic Mission aimed to understand the origin of universe acceleration stuying dark energy and dark matter. To achieve this goal a spacecraft, equipped with two telescopes (VIS and NISP), will be sent to L2 Lagragian zone in 2020. Workflow mission follows strict protocols and expensive components, so goal of this project is try to replicate NISP mechanism that implement CDPU (Central Data Processing Unit) and DAS (Data Acquisition System).

As far as possible we want comply with the state of art and emulate above components using hardware low cost and open licence.
